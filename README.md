Implementation of Lucasâ€“Kanade optical flow to detect and track motion between video frames using OpenCV.

ðŸŽ¥ Optical Flow Detection using Lucasâ€“Kanade Method


This project demonstrates how to detect motion between consecutive video frames using the Lucasâ€“Kanade Optical Flow algorithm, implemented in Python using OpenCV.


ðŸ§  What is Optical Flow?

Optical Flow refers to the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by relative motion between an observer and the scene.

It is used in:

Motion detection

Object tracking

Video stabilization
